# Async Storage

## Introduction

AsyncStorage uses the local storage of devices to save content. The official React Native AsyncStorage is deprecated, so we are using a 3rd party library called [@react-native-async-storage/async-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage).

This library uses the same mechanism.

## Usage

The values are stored by `key -> value` pairs.
