## Introduction

AsyncStorage uses the local storage of devices to save content. The official [React Native AsyncStorage](https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage) is deprecated, so we are using a 3rd party library called [@react-native-async-storage/async-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage).

This library uses the same mechanism.

## Usage

The values are stored by `key -> value` pairs. Basically we store and read data with `setItem` and `getItem` functions.

Check [App.js](./App.js) for a basic usage example.

## Functions

According to the [API documentation](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/api), we have these public functions:
- `getItem`
- `setItem`
- `mergeItem`
- `removeItem`
- `getAllKeys`
- `multiGet`
- `multiSet`
- `multiMerge`
- `multiRemove`
- `clear`
- `useAsyncStorage`

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will be implementing a React Native project with at least 5 screens that consume data from an open API. Additionally, you will explore the use of useState, useEffect, and useContext hooks to manage state and data flow within your application.

### Requirements:

- Create a React Native project that includes the 5 screens desbribed in next topic.
- The screens should be connected through a navigation stack using React Navigation.
- Your application should consume data from an open API. You can choose any API ([public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)) that provides data relevant to your application.
- You should use Axios to make API requests and handle responses.
- Use `useState` hook to manage state within your components. You should use this hook to store data retrieved from the API and any other stateful data required by your application.
- Use `useEffect` hook to manage side effects within your components. You should use this hook to fetch data from the API and perform any other side effects required by your application.
- Use `useContext` hook to manage global state within your application. You should use this hook to share state and data between components that are not directly related in the component tree.

### Required Screens:

1. `Home screen`: Display a list of items retrieved from the API. This screen should demonstrate the use of useState, useEffect, and useContext hooks.
2. `Detail screen`: Display the details of an item selected from the Home screen. This screen should demonstrate the use of props to pass data between screens.
3. `Search screen`: Allow users to search for items based on a keyword. This screen should demonstrate the use of TextInput and search functionality.
4. `Favorites screen`: Display a list of items that have been marked as favorites by the user. This screen should demonstrate the use of `AsyncStorage` to persist data between sessions.
5. `Settings screen`: Allow users to configure settings for the application. This screen should demonstrate the use of checkboxes, switches, and other input components. Save these settings using `AsyncStorage`.
