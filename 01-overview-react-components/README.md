# Rules of JSX

- We can assemble different JSX elements like normal HTML
- We configure different JSX elements using `props`
- We can refeer to JS variables inside of a JSX block by using curly braces
- We can assign JSX elements to a variable, then show that variable inside of a JSX block

## Exercise

- Create a new component called `LessonComponent` that:
    - Show two Text elements
    - The first should say `Getting started with React Native!` and have a font size of `45`
    - The second should say `My name is <your name>` and have a font size of `20`
    - For the second text element, assign your name to a variable, then print it up in the JSX element
