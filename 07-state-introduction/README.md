## Introduction

In this lesson we will learn about states. States in React are used to re-render the screen content. We can bind state variables as components paramters or to part of an internal logic.

As seen in image below, states are a system to track a piece of data that will change over time. If the data changes, our app will re-render.

In this project we have three projects with that use states variables.

## Counter Screen

This example is relates to [CounterScreenWrong](./src/screens/CounterScreenWrong.js) and [CounterScreen](./src/screens/CounterScreen.js) screens.

It is a simple counter that can be increased or decreased by pressing the related buttons.

The `CounterScreenWrong` implements this feature declaring the `counter` variable and updating this value in `onPress` events.

If you test this screen, you will check it doesn't works. It happens because the screen contet are not binded to variables. React will re-render the screen only for state variables.

So we need to use state variables to reach our goal.

### Planning the state variables

Before start using the state variables, we need to think about the required ones. It is more about strategy and organization, because complex screens may use a lot of state variables and we don't want more complexity to maintain our codebase.

It is a great strategy answer these next three questions:

1. What piece of data is changing in our app?
2. What type of data is it?
3. What is the data's starting (default) value?

![](../assets/2022-10-23-22-11-42.png)

For the counter screen we need to update the `current count` value. This type of data can be a `number`. Finally, this value is initiallized as `zero`.

The image below demonstrates the three answers for this problem.

The next example is a screen that shows a name typed in a `TextInput` component and shows this value in a `Text` element.

In this case we need to keep updating the name value. So the state variable is the `name`, this type is a `string` and the initial value is an empty string `''`.

The last example is a screen that reads a collection of blog posts from a data source. Since it is a dynamic data, we need to update the `blogPosts` as an `array` type. Also we can initialize as an empty array `[]`.

### Few notes on state

- We are using function-based state in a functional component. React also has class-based components that have access to [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html).
- We *never* directly modify a state variable. React doesn't detect this change! Only use the `setter` function.
- We can name the state variable anything we wish.
- We can track any kind of data that changes over time - a number, string, array of ojects, etc.
- When a component is rerendered, *all of its children get rerendered too*.
- A state variable can be passed to a child component! At that point, the state variable is now being used as `props`.

## Color Screen

In the [ColorScreen](./src/screens/ColorScreen.js) we are creating random colors by pressing the `Add Color` button.

Here we need the to update the `colors` value. So we will use an `array of strings` as state variable with an empty array as default value.

![](../assets/2022-10-23-22-50-46.png)

In [ColorScreen](./src/screens/ColorScreen.js) we need to pay attention at some lines of code.

First of all, we need to import the `useState` Hook. According to [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#whats-a-hook): 

> A Hook is a special function that lets you "hook into" React features. For example, `useState` is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

The next step is declare the state variable and his setter function. In the code line below we have the `colors` variable and the `setColors` setter function. 

The default value is passed as an argument of `useState` function call.

```js
const [colors, setColors] = useState([])
```

We have to call the `setColors` function to update the `colors` state variable. Here is an example to put elements into `colors` state variable:

```js
setColors(['red', 'green', '#0a03ff'])
```

After call this function, the screen will rerender assuming the `['red', 'green', '#0a03ff']` is assigned to `colors` value.

So in [ColorScreen](./src/screens/ColorScreen.js) we are adding a new `rgb` color into `colors` by pressing the `Add Color` button.

The auxliary `randomRgb` function is called in `onPress` event and returns a random color.

Finally, the `FlatList` element points to `colors` as a data source. This component renders a `View` with the random `backgroundColor` and a `Text` showing the color value.

## Color Mix Screen

The [ColorMixScreen](./src/screens/ColorMixScreen.js) is our third example that shows how to plan and use states in a complex point of view.

In this screen we are building our color configuring the amount of `red`, `green` and `blue`. 

![](../assets/2022-10-23-23-22-46.png)

Answering the three main questions, we have to update the data by each color component. So, we will have the `red`, `green` and `blue` state variables.

These variables are `number` and the initial value is `255`.

![](../assets/2022-10-23-23-24-26.png)

We have the [ColorCounter](./src/components/ColorCounter.js) component to avoid ambiguous code. This component have the callbacks for `Increase` and `Decrease` actions.

Now we can start to think where should we have to create the state variables? In screen or component?

![](../assets/2022-10-23-23-35-41.png)

![](../assets/2022-10-23-23-36-13.png)

Generally, we create state variables in the most parent component that needs to read or change a state value.

![](../assets/2022-10-23-23-37-40.png)

In this example, we are passing a callback function as a `prop` to change the color component state.

![](../assets/2022-10-23-23-39-37.png)

In [ColorMixScreen](./src/screens/ColorMixScreen.js) we passed the `onIncrease` and `onDedrease` callbacks to update the current color component. Also, we passed the color component in the `color` props just to show the color label to user.

```js
<ColorCounter
    onIncrease={() => setColor(blue, COLOR_INCREMENT, setBlue)}
    onDecrease={() => setColor(blue, -1 * COLOR_INCREMENT, setBlue)}
    color='Blue'
/>
```

The `setColor` function validates the color adjustment because the range of the each color component should be between `0` and `255`. When the new color component value is allowed, we update the color component state with the new value.
